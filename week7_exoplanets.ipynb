    "# Exoplanets!\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we're going to think about exoplanet *habitability*. We’re going to be working with the Exoplanets Archive, a database that tracks every exoplanet detected so far. In the first part of the workbook, you’ll practice working with the database and take a look at different planet properties. Then we’ll make a calculator to find habitable zones for each exoplanet system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### background\n",
    "If you want to read more context about exoplanets and habitable zones, you can take a look at these links:\n",
    "- [exolanet article](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/what-is-an-exoplanet/overview/)\n",
    "- [NASA habitable zone article](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/search-for-life/habitable-zone/)\n",

    "### habitable zones\n",
    "Let's go through the steps of constructing an equation to identify where the habitable zone will be for any given star. Schematically, we're going to try and figure out how far away a planet must be from its host star in order to host life.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, let's remind ourselves what defines the habitable zone. What temperature should a planet's surface be in order to be considered part of the habitable zone?\n",
    "2. Let's try and figure out how we can calculate the surface temperature of a planet:\n",
    "    1. Draw a diagram of the host star (with a radius $R_\\star$ and temperture $T_\\star$) and a planet orbiting that star (with a radius $R_{\\rm planet}$ and temperature $T_{\\rm planet}$) at a distance $d$.\n",
    "\t2. If the star emits light in all directions with a luminosity (energy/s) $L_\\star$, what fraction of that energy will be collected by the planet? This is a purely geometric effect -- try and write an expression for the energy that the planet receives $L_{\\rm rec}$. (it might help to think about the area of the planet that is available to collect light)\n",
    "\t3. For simplicity, let's assume that the planet collects all this incident energy and then re-radiates it. When an object emits light like this, we can write the amount of energy it outputs per unit time at its surface as $L = 4\\pi R^2\\sigma_{\\rm SB}T^4$, where $T$ is the object's temperature, $R$ is its radius, and $\\sigma_{\\rm SB} = 5.67\\times 10^{-5}\\ {\\rm erg\\ cm^{-2}\\ s^{-1}\\ K^{-4}}$ is a constant. *note that because we've expressed $\\sigma_{\\rm SB}$ in CGS units, this means that $R, T,$ and $L$ must be in CGS units as well (${\\rm cm,\\ K,\\ erg/s}$, respectively).*  Using this equation, solve for the temperature of the planet in terms of the energy that it's received $L_{\\rm rec}$.\n",
    "\t4. Combine the expressions from steps 2 and 3 to solve for the temperature of the planet. What does this quantity depend on? Do the dependences make sense?\n",
    "\t5. Invert this expression to solve for the distance of the planet given this temperature. This will come in handy later in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### coding\n",
    "Ok, enough background and algebra, let's code some of this up! First, let's import the modules we'll need:"

    "## Exoplanet Data -- Practice with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "The NASA exoplanet archive (https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) keep track of all of the known exoplanet systems. We'll start by reading in the data from the exoplanet archive into something called a data frame (basically just a spreadsheet that we can use to organize the planet systems and their properties). \n",

    "As you've seen, the habitable zone depends on the properties of the host star. We classify stars into different types based on properties like temperature and color (https://www.britannica.com/science/stellar-classification). Using your data table, plot the range of the habitable zone against different stellar properties. To show the inner and outer limits of each star's zone, you can use the function plt.axvline(x, ymin, ymax), where ymin and ymax are the inner and outer radii of the zone and x is the value of the stellar property. Try a few different properties (temperature, radius, mass, luminosity) -- you can find a full list at this link, in the stellar properties table https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_PS_columns.html. How do the habitable zones change with stellar properties? \n",

You can read about different exoplanet detection methods [here](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/?intent=021). Which planets are easiest to detect? Based on this, what types of stars should we be targeting for habitable zone planet searches? "
