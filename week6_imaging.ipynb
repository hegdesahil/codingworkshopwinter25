There are several operations that we almost always perform when plotting astronomical data, as well as several user-preferences for how we \"by default\" plot images before we begin tweaking things. If you spend any time as an astronomer, you will plot quite literally *thousands* of images --- why set all these settings every time, when we can write a handy function to do it for us?\n",

When working in notebooks, it is often useful to set the `figsize` argument of subplots to a nice large-ish value, such as `(15,13)`, which will make the image fill most of the notebook. Since *your* function has set figsize as an argument, you can feed `figsize` directly into the `subplots` call, so that a user of the function can leave the default or set their own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, use `ax.imshow()` to actually plot the image. You'll want to save the output of this, e.g., `im = ax.imshow(...)`. In this plotting call, set `imshow`'s argument `origin='lower'`. We *always* want to do this when dealing with imaging, as we want (0,0) to be a coordinate. \n",

    "Also within the call to `imshow()`, feed in the cmap from your function (i.e., `cmap=cmap`). The other critical `imshow()` arguments are `vmin` and `vmax`, which sets the saturation points (and thus the contrast) of the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't set `vmin` and `vmax` as arguments of our outer function, but because of `kwargs`, we can still create a default here that can be overriden from outside. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a default, within your function, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the image. Set some temporary variables with the quantities `mu - scale*sigma` and `mu + scale*sigma` (where here `mu` is the calculated mean and `sigma` is the calculated std dev, and `scale` was the optional input). Next, check the kwargs dictionary (which will exist in your function because we added the packing argument `**kwargs` to our function. IF `vmin` and `vmax` are in this dictionary, plug those into your imshow command. Otherwise, use the values determined by the calculation above.\n",

Loosely, `sep` uses C-bindings to actually run the heavy lifting code in C rather than Python (it's faster). This means input arrays must be arranged in physical memory the way C is used to. This particular array was not, but it is easy to order it this way. The first line in the function below shows how to do that."
